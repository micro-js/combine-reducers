Combines an object of reducers together to form a single, composite reducer. This function is identical to the one provided by [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) but it doesn't do the sanity checks that redux does, which allows you to do a few things like having multiple root reducers combined into one that you can't do with redux's assertions.

## Installation

    $ npm install @f/combine-reducers

## Usage

```js
var combineReducers = require('@f/combine-reducers')

combineReducers({
  counter1: counterReducer,
  counter2: counterReducer
})

function counterReducer (state, action) {
  if (action.type === INCREMENT) {
    return ++state
  }

  return state
}
```

## API

### combineReducers(reducers)

- `reducers` - An object containing a map of reducers to property names
- `defaultState` - Optional. Specify a default value for the state object. Useful for nesting `combineReducers` calls.

**Returns:** The combined reducer map as a single reducing function.
